abstract={The theorem of three circles in real algebraic geometry guarantees the termination and correctness of an algorithm of isolating real roots of a univariate polynomial. The main idea of its proof is to consider polynomials whose roots belong to a certain area of the complex plane delimited by straight lines. After applying a transformation involving inversion this area is mapped to an area delimited by circles. We provide a formalisation of this rather geometric proof in Ssreflect, an extension of the proof assistant Coq, that supports a variety of algebraic tools. They allow us to formalise the proof from an algebraic point of view.},
