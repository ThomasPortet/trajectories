    abstract = {{T}his document describes a set of extensions to the proof scripting language of the {C}oq proof assistant. {W}hile these extensions were developed to support a particular proof methodology - small-scale reflection - most of them actually are of a quite general nature, improving the functionality of {C}oq in basic areas such as script layout and structuring, proof context management, and rewriting. {C}onsequently, and in spite of the title of this document, most of the extensions described here should be of interest for all {C}oq users, whether they embrace small-scale reflection or not.},
