  ## Development information

  On April 2, 2023, a file `smooth_trajectories.v` was added to illustrate a
  program to compute smooth trajectories for a "point" between obstacles given
  by straight edges.

  The example can be played with by changing the contents of variables 
  `example_bottom`, `example_top`, `example_edge_list`, and changing
  the coordinates of points given as argument to `example_test` in the
  `Compute` command that appears at the end of the file.  This compute
   commands produces text that should be placed in a postscript file and
   can be displayed with any postscript enabled viewer.  A perl-script is
   provided to produce this, so that the following command is a handy
   way to produce example outputs:

   ```
   (cd theories; ./run_tests.sh)
   ```

  At the time of writing this paragraph, the code seems complete but
  many bugs have been found in parts of the code that have not been proved
  formally.

  If you play with this code and you obtain a trajectory that obviously
  crosses the given edges, please report.
